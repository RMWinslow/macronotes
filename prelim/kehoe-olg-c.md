# Pareto efficiency in an overlapping generations economy

## Part c) Pareto Efficiency

Define a Pareto efficient allocation.
Either prove that the equilibrium allocation in part a is Pareto efficient or prove that it is not.


<details markdown="block"><summary>Define a Pareto efficient allocation.</summary>

An allocation is *Pareto Efficient* if it is feasible and there is no alternative feasible outcome which makes at least one generation better off and no generations worse off.

### Feasible Allocation

To be Pareto efficient, an allocation $$\{c_t^t, c_{t+1}^t\}_{t=0}^\infty, \{c_1^0\}$$ must be feasible, meaning that for all $t=1,2,...$:

$$c_t^t + c_t^{t-1} = w_t^t + w_t^{t-1}$$

$$c_t^t \geq 0$$

$$c_t^{t-1} \geq 0$$

### No feasible Pareto improvments
