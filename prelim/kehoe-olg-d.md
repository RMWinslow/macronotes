# Pareto efficiency in an overlapping generations economy


Consider an overlapping generations economy in which there is one good in each period
and each generation, except the initial one, lives for two periods. The representative
consumer in generation $t, t = 1,2,...,$ has the utility function

$$\ln (c_t^t) + c_{t+1}^t$$

and the endowment $(w_t^t, w_{t+1}^t)=(1,2)$.
The representative consumer in generation $0$ lives only in period $1$,
prefers more consumption to less, and has the endowment $w_1^0 = 2$


## Part d) Storage

Suppose now that there is a storage technology availible in every period $t, t=1,2,...$ that transforms one unit of the good in period $t$ into $\gamma > 0$ units of the good in period $t+1$. Define a sequential markets equilibrium for this economy. Under what conditions on $\gamma$ will the storage technology be used in equilibrium?
