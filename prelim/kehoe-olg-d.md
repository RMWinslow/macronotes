# Pareto efficiency in an overlapping generations economy

## Part d) Storage

Suppose now that there is a storage technology availible in every period $t, t=1,2,...$ that transforms one unit of the good in period $t$ into $\gamma > 0$ units of the good in period $t+1$. Define a sequential markets equilibrium for this economy. Under what conditions on $\gamma$ will the storage technology be used in equilibrium?
